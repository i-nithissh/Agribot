# 🌾 Agribot: Smart Farming System 🤖🌱

Agribot is a smart farming solution that leverages IoT (Internet of Things) and Machine Learning to optimize agricultural practices. This project aims to provide real-time monitoring and crop recommendations based on sensor data such as soil moisture, pH, TDS, and more. Additionally, it includes a disease detection feature using node cameras, ensuring proactive intervention for better crop health and yield.

## ✨ Features
- 🌍 Real-time Monitoring: Track soil moisture, pH, TDS, and other critical environmental parameters using sensors.
- 📊 Automated Crop Recommendations: Provide data-driven recommendations for optimal crop selection based on soil conditions and weather data.
- 📸 Disease Detection: Use node cameras and Machine Learning to detect early signs of plant diseases.
- ☁️ Cloud Integration: Send real-time sensor data to the cloud (ThingSpeak) for easy access and analysis.
- 🖥️ Web App Dashboard: Visualize data and control IoT devices through a user-friendly web app interface.
- 💧 Automation: Enable automatic irrigation and fertilization based on sensor readings to improve efficiency.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- IoT: Arduino-based microcontroller, various sensors (e.g., soil moisture, pH sensor).
- Machine Learning: Disease detection using image processing and ML models.
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the web application interface.
- Cloud Integration: ThingSpeak for data storage and visualization.
- Database:*Coud-based storage for sensor data.

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements
- Arduino (or any compatible microcontroller)
- 🌱 Soil Moisture Sensor
- 🧪 pH Sensor
- 💧 TDS Sensor
- 📷 Node Camera for disease detection
- 📡 Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
- ⚡ Power supply and other basic electronic components

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/i-nithissh/agribot.git
   cd agribot
   ```

2. Set up the hardware:
   - Connect the sensors and node camera to the Arduino microcontroller following the wiring instructions in the hardware documentation.
   - Ensure the Wi-Fi module is configured to send data to ThingSpeak.

3. Configure ThingSpeak:
   - Create a ThingSpeak account and set up a new channel.
   - Obtain the API keys and add them to the `config.js` file in the web app for real-time data visualization.

4. Deploy the web application:
   - Host the web app locally or deploy it via GitHub Pages.
   - Navigate to the `index.html` file to access the real-time dashboard.

## 📈 Usage
1. Start the Arduino:
   - Once all the hardware is connected, power on the Arduino. The sensors will start collecting data, and the node camera will monitor the crops for disease detection.
   
2. Monitor via Web App:
   - Access the web application to monitor sensor data, crop recommendations, and disease alerts in real time.

3. Automate farming processes:
   - Based on the sensor readings, automate irrigation, fertilization, or disease prevention measures.
